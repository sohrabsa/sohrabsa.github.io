I am a postdoctoral research fellow at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics under Drs. [Sohrab P. Shah](https://www.mskcc.org/research-areas/labs/sohrab-shah), [Charles M. Rudin](https://www.mskcc.org/research-areas/labs/charles-rudin), and a postdoctoral research scientist at the Irving Institute for Cancer Dynamics at Columbia Univeristy under Dr. [David M. Blei](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~blei/). My current research focuses on developing causal inference methods to understand mechanisms of drug-resistance and metastasis in human cancers at a single cell level. I did my PhD in Bioinformatics at University of British Columbia (UBC) under Dr. [Alexandre Bouchard-C&ocirc;t&eacute;](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~bouchard/). My PhD research focused on developing Bayesian models to quantify the evolutionary dynamics and fitness of human cancers from single cell whole genome sequencing data.
